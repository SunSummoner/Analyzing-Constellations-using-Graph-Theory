# Analyzing Constellations using Graph Theory

This project was implemented by Kritika Verma and Siddhartha Mahajan under Dr. Nirmal Yadav during the course of their Discrete Mathematics paper.
It focuses on graph properties of the
constellations including their Hamiltonian path and
circuit,and Eulerâ€™s path and circuit
